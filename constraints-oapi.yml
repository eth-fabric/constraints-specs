  title: "Constraints API"
  description: |
    API governing interaction between preconfers and gateways, which enables gateways to submit constraints to builders. 

    All requests by default send and receive JSON, and as such should have either or both of the "Content-Type: application/json"
    and "Accept: application/json" headers.  In addition, some requests can return data in the SSZ format.  To indicate that SSZ
    data is required in response to a request the header "Accept: application/octet-stream" should be sent.  Note that only a subset
    of requests can respond with data in SSZ format; these are noted in each individual request.

      summary: "Endpoint for Proposer or Gateway to submit a batch of signed constraints to the Relay"
      description: "Endpoint for submitting a batch of constraints to the relay. The constraints are expected to be signed by a `delegate` BLS private key, whose corresponding public key is specified in a `SignedDelegation` message.

      For each `Preconfirmation` the delegate signs, they will need to create a matching `Constraint`. Collectively, a `SignedConstraints` message is posted to the Relay.

      - `constraintType`: unsigned 64-bit number between `0` and `0xffffffffffffffff` that represents the type of the proposer commitment

      - `payload`: opaque byte array whose interpretation is dependent on the `constraintType`

      
      Particularly each `constraintType` would have a corresponding specification that defines:

      - A schema for a `Preconfirmation` and `SignedPreconfirmation` message

      - How a `Constraint.payload` is interpreted

      - How a `Constraint.payload` is created given a `SignedPreconfirmation`

      - The ordering of `Constraints[]`

      - How to build a valid block given a `ConstraintsMessage`

      - How to generate proofs of constraint validity
        
      - How to verify proofs of constraint validity


      To ensure deterministic behavior for stateful constraints it is *required* for the `ConstraintsMessage.Constraints[]` to be processed in the order received."

      summary: "Endpoint for Proposer to delegate preconfirmation rights, or more accurately, constraint submission rights to a Gateway"
      description: "
A proposer can delegate preconfirmations rights by signing a `Delegate` message with their proposer BLS private key. A `SignedDelegation` binds the proposer public key to the delegate public key and a slasher contract until after the `valid_until` slot elapses. During this time, the delegate can submit `SignedConstraints` to the relay on behalf of the proposer. While the Constraints API aims to be unopinionated about how slasher contracts are implemented, it's assumed that `SignedDelegation` messages are part of the evidence used to slash a proposer.

    - `proposer`: The BLS public key of the proposer who is delegating preconfirmation rights
    
    - `delegate`: The BLS public key of the gateway who is receiving preconfirmation rights
    
    - `slasher`: The address of a slasher contract containing a `slash()` function to penalize a proposer who has violated constraints (i.e., reneged on a preconf)
    
    - `valid_until`: slot number (inclusive) that a `SignedDelegation` is considered valid until
    
    - `metadata`: Additional opaque byte array reserved for and interpreted by the `slash()` function and/or the gateway (e.g., gas limit, blob limit, chain ID, preconfirmation type)
