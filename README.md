# Ethereum Commitment API Specifications

This repo contains an open and neutral API specification for proposer commitments on Ethereum. These standards are currently under review / feedback and are not audited. 

### Render API Specification
To render spec in browser, you will simply need an HTTP server to load the index.html file in root of the repo.

For example:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive # don't forge the submodules!
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

The spec will render at http://localhost:8080.
